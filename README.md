# language-translation

I trained a model that translates spanish sentences to english using Encoder and Decoder Models. The Encoder accepts the spanish data feed into its neural network, then tries to recognize patterns in decoding the data with a `learning rate = 0.001` after which predicts the best english equivalent for the spanish word entered.

# Installations
libraries neeeded to run the model
